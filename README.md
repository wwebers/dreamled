# Dreamled

This one's a composition of the ideas of the wonderfull [LEDEffect](https://github.com/Diaoul/LEDEffect) library by [Antoine Bertin](https://github.com/Diaoul) and some MEMS based effects of [FastLED-Demos](https://github.com/atuline/FastLED-Demos) by [Andrew Tuline](https://github.com/atuline).

My tribute go to their inspiration.

I modified Antoine's idea as I had no need of JSON persistence. However, I really liked the sound based effects made by Andrew.

# Controller case

I designed a tiny controller case for the electronics which can be found on [Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/9027f2b98f636bc1998e50a7/w/1adeb3ca54aaa36f2728e306/e/9f04a6cb8f7ab5fb481c7800). Feel free to modify it.
